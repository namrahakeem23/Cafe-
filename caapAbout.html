                <p class="intro">HEY! WELCOME TO CAPPUCCINO —</p>
                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>At the turn of the century, in the late 1990’s, a 20 year old budding entrepreneur had a dream… to
                    have access to a café like the ones on the streets of Milan and Venice, but in the ‘city of Nawabs’
                    instead. With a glint in her eye and cruising on pure hope & ambition, she laid the foundation of a
                    unique concept, tucked away in a leafy little lane in Mall Avenue. The dreamer was Puja Rahul Nemani
                    and the dream was Cappuccino Blast.</p>
                <p>Colloquially referred to as just ‘Cappi’, it started with a mere five tables and just a handful of
                    delicious nibbles where you could find her waiting tables for her earliest patrons. This quaint
                    little venture became Lucknow’s first café and eventually, one of Lucknow’s culinary landmarks.</p>
                <p>Cappi gave the city a place they could call their own…a quiet space where they could meet friends,
                    listen to live music, get a taste of food festivals or just unwind and chill out with a cup of their
                    favourite coffee. Since its inception in the year 2000 Cappi has changed various avatars.</p>
                <p>In addition to being known for some of the best food and hookahs in town, Cappi has been host to
                    corporate bashes, private jewelry and garment exhibits, Holi / Diwali / Christmas celebrations,
                    salsa and ballet classes, poetry recitals, a lifestyle store, a novelty gift shop, Sunday brunches,
                    birthday parties and many more fantastic and lifelong memories.</p>
                <p>We have also been host to Bollywood shootings for movies like Rajkumar Rao’s ‘Shaadi mein Zaroor
                    Aana’ and Emraan Hashmi’s ‘Why Cheat India’ amongst others.</p>
                <p>Divided into various seating sections, patrons can choose from the Open To Sky Café nestled amongst
                    gazebos, swaying bamboo plants, and pop art covered walls - the Fine Dining area adorning with
                    antique European tiles, original Ravi Verma prints, Bohemian artwork and silken tapestries — the
                    Colonial Bar with wood paneled walls and Chesterfield couches for the perfect evening drink — the
                    Pizzeria with the wood fired oven churning out delectable Napolitan pizzas OR the Terrace Café just
                    to get away from it all.</p>
                <p>The perfect place for a family night-out, a romantic meal or just meeting old friends over coffee or
                    drinks Cappi offers its patrons an unforgettable experience.</p>
                <p>We thank our patrons for a being a part of the Cappuccino Blast story. We exist because of YOU.
                    Please keep coming back and honour us with the opportunity to serve you.</p>

                <h1>YOUR HOST</h1>
                <p>
                    Puja Nemani is the founder and owner of the Cappuccino Blast (Cappi). She started her career with
                    selling stained glass paintings in exhibitions all over India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her love for coffee gave Lucknow its first real cafe in the year 2000 which seated about 15 people
                    with 20 items on the menu. In addition to the original cafe, over the last 3 decades her efforts
                    have organically grown the establishment to include a fine dine restaurant, a colonial style bar,
                    premium banqueting spaces, a pizzeria, a gift shop and out-door catering services across Lucknow.
                    Her business is fuelled by her passion for good food and decor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She inherited her creative instincts from her mother, Mrs Rashmi Vaid and her dedication and
                    motivation from her grandfather, the Late Mr. Sajjan Kumar Vaid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is known to constantly reinvent the decor and menus at Cappuccino to provide her patrons with
                    unique experiences. This includes food festivals featuring cuisines from all over the globe by
                    inviting specialty chefs and artists. Puja is also an antique enthusiast and regularly dabbles in
                    relics from the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She has received numerous accolades as an entrepreneur from various national forums including being
                    felicitated by the former CM of UP, Hon. Sri Akhilesh Yadav. Puja is involved with various animal
                    rescue and protection efforts and has adopted numerous stray cows and dogs across Lucknow who are
                    fed daily from the Cappuccino kitchens. She runs a home canine adoption centre where she adopts
                    injured and abandoned dogs and puts them up for adoption after having them treated. Her
                    philanthropic efforts include her involvement with supporting cancer affected children and enabling
                    higher education for under-privileged girls in Rajasthan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Puja spends her time between homes in Lucknow, Mumbai, Goa and Rajasthan with her husband Rahul and
                    their three daughters Samaara, Tara & Siya.
